  \frametitle{Problem Description}
    Goal: to obtain quantitative \textbf{perfusion indices} from pwiMRI images
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{CBF}: Cerebral Blood Flow. The rate at which blood is delivered. $Q [mL/100g]$
        \item \textbf{CBV}: Cerebral Blood Volume. The total volume of blood present. $V[mL/100g]$
        \item \textbf{MTT}: Mean Transit Time. The average duration that blood spends transiting. $MTT[s]$
        \item $\mathbf{T_{max}}$: Time to Maximum of the Residue Function. The time required for the residue function of a tracer to reach its peak, indicative of cerebral perfusion efficiency. $T_{max}[s]$
    \end{itemize}
