  abstract = {Abstract             Cerebral perfusion imaging using dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) has been the subject of considerable research and shows promise for basic science and clinical use. In DSC, the MRI signals in brain tissue and feeding arteries are monitored dynamically in response to a bolus injection of paramagnetic agents, such as gadolinium (Gd) chelates. DSC has the potential to allow quantitative imaging of parameters such as cerebral blood flow (CBF) with a high signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) in a short scan time; however, quantitation depends critically on accurate and precise measurement of the arterial input function (AIF). We discuss many requirements and factors that make it difficult to measure the AIF. The AIF signal should be linear with respect to Gd concentration, convertible to the same concentration scale as the tissue signal, and independent of hematocrit. Complicated relationships between signal and concentration can violate these requirements. The additional requirements of a high SNR and high spatial/temporal resolution are technically challenging. AIF measurements can also be affected by signal saturation and aliasing, as well as dispersion/delay between the AIF sampling site and the tissue. We present new in vivo preliminary results for magnitude‐based (ΔR2*) and phase‐based (Δϕ) AIF measurements that show a linearity advantage of phase, and a disparity in the scaling of Δϕ AIFs, ΔR2* AIFs, and ΔR2* tissue curves. Finally, we discuss issues related to the choice of AIF signal for quantitative perfusion imaging. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2005. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {The glymphatic system is functional waste clearance path from the brain parenchyma through dynamic exchange of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with interstitial fluid (ISF). Impairment of glymphatic waste clearance is involved in the development of neurodegenerative conditions. Despite many recent studies investigating the glymphatic system, few studies have tried to use a mathematical model to describe this system, quantitatively. In this study, we aim to model the glymphatic system from the kinetics of Gd-DTPA tracer measured using MRI in order to: 1) map the glymphatic system path, 2) derive kinetic parameters of the glymphatic system, and 3) provide quantitative maps of the structure and function of this system. In the proposed model, the brain is clustered to similar regions with respect to the profile of contrast agent (CA) density measured by MRI. Then, each region is described as a two-compartment kinetic model ‘derived from’ or ‘clears to’ its neighbors with local input function. We thus fit our model to the local cerebral regions rather than to the averaged time signal curve (TSC) of the whole brain. The estimated parameters showed distinctive differences between diabetes mellitus (DM) and control rats. The results suggest that in a typical DM brain the CSF bulk speed in the para-vasculature network is low. In addition, the resulting maps indicate that there may be increased binding and decreased absorbing of large molecules in a diabetic compared with a non-diabetic brain. The important contribution of this work was to fit the model to the local regions rather than to the averaged time signal curve (TSC) of the whole brain. This enabled us to derive quantitative maps of the glymphatic system from MRI.},

This study evaluates the validity and performance of a commonly used multiplicative rescaling of the AIF to correct for the PVE. In a group of six patients, perfusion imaging was performed using a               T               1               ‐weighted approach that minimizes confounding susceptibility artifacts. Various degrees of PVE were induced on the AIF and subsequently corrected using four different schemes of multiplicative AIF rescaling. Our results show that a multiplicative rescaling is not always applicable and can introduce a CBF bias. An easily measurable quantity denoted the tissue signal fraction (TSF) is proposed as a measure of the applicability of a multiplicative rescaling. For the present CBF quantification method, a TSF of {$<$}0.4 results in a CBF bias {$<$}15\% after AIF rescaling. Magn Reson Med, 2009. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The concentration of MRI tracers cannot be measured directly by MRI and is commonly evaluated indirectly using their relaxation effect. This study develops a comprehensive theoretical model to describe the transverse relaxation in perfused tissue caused by intravascular tracers. The model takes into account a number of individual compartments. The signal dephasing is simulated in a semianalytical way by embedding Monte Carlo simulations in the framework of analytical theory. This approach yields a tool for fast, realistic simulation of the change in the transverse relaxation. The results indicate that the relaxivity of intravascular contrast agents depends significantly on the host tissue. This agrees with experimental data by Johnson et al. (Magn Reson Med 2000;44:909). In particular, the present results suggest a several‐fold increase in the relaxivity of Gd‐based contrast agents in brain tissue compared with bulk blood. The enhancement of relaxation in tissue is due to the contrast in magnetic susceptibility between blood vessels and parenchyma induced by the presence of paramagnetic tracer. Beyond the perfusion measurements, the results can be applied to quantitation of functional MRI and to vessel size imaging. Magn Reson Med, 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

Early assessment of the mismatch facilitates necessary diagnosis and treatment decisions in acute stroke. We developed the               RA               pid processing of               P               erfus               I               on and               D               iffusion (RAPID) for unsupervised, fully automated processing of perfusion and diffusion data for the purpose of expedited routine clinical assessment. The RAPID system computes quantitative perfusion maps (cerebral blood volume, CBV; cerebral blood flow, CBF; mean transit time, MTT; and the time until the residue function reaches its peak,               T               max               ) using deconvolution of tissue and arterial signals. Diffusion‐weighted imaging/perfusion‐weighted imaging (DWI/PWI) mismatch is automatically determined using infarct core segmentation of ADC maps and perfusion deficits segmented from               T               max               maps. The performance of RAPID was evaluated on 63 acute stroke cases, in which diffusion and perfusion lesion volumes were outlined by both a human reader and the RAPID system. The correlation of outlined lesion volumes obtained from both methods was               r               2               = 0.99 for DWI and               r               2               = 0.96 for PWI. For mismatch identification, RAPID showed 100\% sensitivity and 91\% specificity. The mismatch information is made available on the hospital's PACS within 5–7 min. Results indicate that the automated system is sufficiently accurate and fast enough to be used for routine care as well as in clinical trials. J. Magn. Reson.

First, calibration curves representing the influence of the concentration of Gd‐DTPA on both the phase and the amplitude of the MR signal were measured in human blood by means of a slow‐infusion experiment. The results showed a linear increase in the phase velocity and a quadratic increase in Δ               R                              as a function of the Gd‐DTPA concentration. Next, the resultant calibration curves were incorporated in a partial volume correction algorithm for the arterial input function determination. The algorithm was tested in a phantom experiment and was found to substantially improve the accuracy of the concentration measurement. Finally, the reproducibility of the arterial input function measurement was estimated in 16 patients by considering the input function of the left and the right sides as replicate measurements. This in vivo study showed that the reproducibility of the arterial input function determination using gradient echo sequences is improved by employing a partial volume correction algorithm based on the calibration curve for the contrast agent used.

This study proposes a technique that is made time‐shift insensitive by the use of a block‐circulant matrix for deconvolution with (oSVD) and without (cSVD) minimization of oscillation of the derived residue function. The performances of these methods are compared with standard SVD (sSVD) in both numerical simulations and in clinically acquired data. An additional index of disturbed hemodynamics (oDelay) is proposed that represents the tracer arrival time difference between the AIF and tissue signal. Results show that PWI estimates from sSVD are weighted by tracer arrival time differences, while those from oSVD and cSVD are not. oSVD also provides estimates that are less sensitive to blood volume compared to cSVD. Using PWI data that can be routinely collected clinically, oSVD shows promise in providing tracer arrival timing‐insensitive flow estimates and hence a more specific indicator of ischemic injury. Shift maps can continue to provide a sensitive reflection of disturbed hemodynamics. Magn Reson Med 50:164–174, 2003. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},
